# Two general algorithms for performing the partial secular approximation on the Redfield equation

This repository accompanies the upcoming manuscript "Two general algorithms for performing the partial secular approximation on the Redfield equation".

## Installation

Clone the repository and install the required packages using
```python 
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

## Running the script

The file `me_func_defs.py` contains all the functions required to compute the open quantum system dynamics. One should define their own Hamiltonian describing the system under study in a separate file and call the functions by importing `me_func_defs.py` to that file. See the jupyter notebook example `Example-notebook.ipynb` on how the functions can be used.
